- Designed a PID-based control system to regulate liquid levels by adjusting the speed of a DC motor-driven pump
- Conducted MATLAB simulations to evaluate system performance metrics, including rise time and settling time
- Achieved an efficient control system by analyzing overshoot and steady-state error for various configurations
