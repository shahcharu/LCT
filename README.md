- Developed a PID-based control system to maintain the desired liquid level in a tank
- Varied the speed of a DC motor-driven pump to control incoming liquid flow rate of the container.
- Demonstrated the accuracy of the control system through MATLAB simulations.
- Analysed rise time, settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error of different controller configurations
